# [](#introduction)Introduction

Snaptrash is a start-up solution that impressed me when I first time notice about it.
As it will let the users take a picture of the trash item around their live, and share
it to the social.

## System solution
I will in charge of developing the system as an individual developer. The system will contains
the server, web admin, mobile app (both Android and iOS version).
